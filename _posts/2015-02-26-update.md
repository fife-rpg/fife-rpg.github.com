Heya!

I just realized that it's over a year since the last post, so for those that are actually reading this I just wanted to say, that fife-rpg ist still alive.
The current version on github is waiting to be release, which can only happen after the version of fife with the changes to gui libraries has been released.

Meanwhile I have been working on an editor for fife-rpg which is coming along nicely. Since it uses CEGUI it can also only be released after the next fife-rpg release.

Beliar
